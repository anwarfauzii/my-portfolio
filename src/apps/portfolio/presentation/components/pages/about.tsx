          I am a graduate of Vocational High School, specializing in Informatics Engineering, with a
          focus on Software Engineering. Currently, I am gaining further knowledge by pursuing
          studies at Universitas Terbuka, enrolled in the Faculty of Science and Technology.
          Concurrently, I am also employed as a Frontend Developer,
          <br /> <br />
          Ever since I entered Vocational High School, I've been captivated by programming. However,
          I soon realized that the knowledge I gained there was limited, prompting me to explore
          other sources such as YouTube, Udemy Courses, Dicoding, and Blogs to expand my skills.
          <br /> <br />
          The world of software development offers a vast array of things to learn and numerous
          technologies to explore, and I am determined to absorb as much as possible. I have a
          strong passion for learning and value feedback to continuously improve and grow.
          <br /> <br />
          I reside in Ciamis, West Java. And I'm always enthusiastic about connecting with new
          people. If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to visit my social media or reach
          out to me via email.
          <br /> <br />
          Thank you, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you!
