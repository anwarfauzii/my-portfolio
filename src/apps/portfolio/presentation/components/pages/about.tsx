          I'm a graduate of Vocational High School, majoring in Informatics Engineering, with
          expertise in Software Engineering. Currently, I'm working as a Frontend Developer.
          <br /> <br />
          Ever since I entered Vocational High School, I've been captivated by programming. However,
          I soon realized that the knowledge I gained there was limited, prompting me to explore
          other sources such as YouTube, Udemy Courses, Dicoding, and Blogs to expand my skills.
          <br /> <br />
          The world of software development offers a vast array of things to learn and numerous
          technologies to explore, and I am determined to absorb as much as possible. I have a
          strong passion for learning and value feedback to continuously improve and grow.
          <br /> <br />
          I reside in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province. And I'm always enthusiastic about
          connecting with new people. If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to visit my
          social media or reach out to me via email.
          <br /> <br />
          Thank you, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you!
